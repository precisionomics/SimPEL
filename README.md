SimPEL

SimPEL is short for Simulation-based Power Estimation for sequencing studies of Low-prevalence conditions. SimPEL addresses the need for
power estimation in low-prevalence condition studies, taking into account their
inherently small sample sizes and analytical procedures. SimPEL integrates
customizable parameters to realistically model study design outcomes and
provide applicable information towards further refinement of experimental
procedure. SimPEL is implemented as a function of the established JAWAMix5 tool
(Long et al., 2013)⁠, an HDF5-based Java implementation for association mapping.

Installation

A tarball will be available for download at https://owncloud.westgrid.ca/index.php/s/s4d86JjmRXycLKZ. The archive will include all mandatory
input files. MD5 hash values for each of the files are also included in the
download. As Java is platform independent and the software comes
“batteries-included,” there is no specific installation required. The JAWAMix5
jar file is ready for immediate use, provided that Java has been installed in
the system. Through this, users can easily verify that they indeed have the
correct files and that no errors have occurred during the download and
extraction process.
